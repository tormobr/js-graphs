# What is JS-Graphs?
JS-Graphs is a playground for pathfinding algorithms using simple `JS`, `HTML` and `CSS` code that. In this playground you can execute different pathfinding algorithms on a grid layout. Is is also possible to draw on the grid, move start/target position, and generate grid-layouts.

The purpose of JS-Graphs is to visualize how different pathfinding algorithms work as well as having fun with it. JS-Graphs can be used as a tool to gain a better understanding of pathfinding algorithms and help you choose the correct algorithms for your problems.
